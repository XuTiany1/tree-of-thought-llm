# Prompt technique number 3: Propose Prompt
# Role in Model Training:
# 	•	Used in the get_proposals function for generating a list of potential moves.
#-----------------------------------------------------

#	•	Purpose: Provides examples of possible next steps the model can take, offering multiple operation suggestions.
#	•	Format: A 1-shot prompt that shows how to transform two numbers into a new number, leaving the rest in place.

# Role in Model Training:
# 	•	 Used in the get_value function to score the likelihood of a particular number combination reaching 24.

#	•	Purpose: Asks the model to evaluate whether a given set of numbers can reach 24, providing judgments such as “sure,” “likely,” or “impossible.”
#	•	Format:  Shows different scenarios with evaluations, such as sure (when 24 can be reached with the given numbers), likely (when it’s possible but uncertain), or impossible.

#	•	Purpose: Checks if a final answer is correct by confirming that it reaches 24 and uses each input number exactly once.
